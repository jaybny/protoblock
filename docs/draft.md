#Satoshi Fantasy
A distributed autonomous fantasy football players only market.  

##Fantasy Name
Fantasy Names are mined into existence in a separate proof-of-work blockchain similar to bitnames for [BitShares](https://github.com/InvictusInnovations/BitShares). A fantasy name is an alias to your public key that corresponds to your private "wallet" key. 

##Fantasy Bits

Fantasy Bits are tokens that get created based on NFL player events.  Each fantsybit is owned by a single Fantasy Name. Fantsybits can be transferred by transactions in the underlying Proof-of-skill block chain.    

Fantsybits are awarded based on:

1. weekly fantasy point projections 
2. player meta-data projections
3. stats and data contributors.
4. transactions fees for block forging

###Proof-of-skill
Proof-of-skill is essentially a [Proof-of-stake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) system, where the stakes are earned based on the skill of projecting weekly fantasy football results. The main downside in other proof-of-stake networks, such as [NXT](http://wiki.nxtcrypto.org/wiki/Whitepaper:Nxt#Proof-of-Stake), is that all tokens must be pre-distributed, creating an unfair advantage to early stake holders. Fantasybits are created by NFL players playing football, so there is no pre-distribution needed.  

###Fantasy Scoring Rules
Standard PPR (points per reception) rules apply. Rules mirror [FFPC](http://www.myffpc.com/footballguys-players-championship/rules.html) (except for 1.5 TE PPR)

	Passing Yards - 1 point per 20 yards or .05 points per yard
	Passing TD - 4 points
	Pass interception - -1 points

	Rushing Yards - 1 point per 10 yards or .1 point per yard
	Rushing TD - 6 points

	Receiving Yards - 1 point per 10 yards or .1 point per yard
	Receiving TD - 6 Points
	Reception - 1 point per reception

	2-point conversion - 2 points for passer, rusher, receiver
	PAT kick - 1 point
	Field Goal - 3 points for 1-30 yards, .1 point for each additional yard.

	**Team Defense / Special Teams**
	Sack - 1 point
	Takeaway (interception or fumble recovery) - 2 points
	Defensive TD - 6 points
	Safety - 5 points
	Shutout - 12 points
	1-6 points allowed - 8 points
	7-10 points allowed - 10 points
	
###Fantasy point projections
100 fantasybits are generated for each real fantasy point earned by an NFL player during the fantasy season. A generation and distribution algorithm determines the number of bits to generate and the names to distribute them to.

The algorithm awards more bits to those with projections that were closest to actual results. 

#####[Distribution Algorithm](https://github.com/jaybny/fantasybit/blob/master/src/DistributionAlgo.cpp) 
1. Calculate average difference of all projections from actual result. 
2. Filter out projections that are below average or have a difference > result.
3. unitpayout = result / (sum of (result-projection))
4. award = 100 * (result - difference) * unitpayout 


###Consensus 
All data in the network, such as fantasy point results, will be determined by the consensus. At least 51% of total Stake Values must agree before data can be included in block. This is done by recursively signing the data payload. 

####Stake Value
Each fantasy name will have four different Stake Values

1. Skill - total historical bits earned from projections.
2. Points - total fantasybits owned * 100. 
2. Data-feed - sum of Skill of all fantasy names that designate you as their feed provider.
3. Time-sync - sum of Points of all fantasy names that designate you as their sync provider.  


##State Machine
System has a built in state machine, and will act differently depending on its current state. A new block with specific data can trigger a transition to a new state. 

1. **Season**
 	- **PreGame**(week[1-16])  
	- **InGame**(week[1-16]) 
	- **TradingSession** - Wed 6pm - 11:59pm EDT 
4. **PreDraft** 
5. **PreSeason**
6. **53ManRoster**

##BlockChain
Satoshi Fantasy uses a Proof-of-Stake(type) system to determine who can mine the next block. Special state transition blocks require 51% consensus from Data-feed or Time-sync stake values 

###~~Transactions~~ Events


Type |Proof      |Target Release  
-----|:---------:|:------:
Projection|Skill|MVP 
State|Data-feed  |Alpha
State|Time-sync  |Beta
Transaction|Points|Prod

####Transitions


	Data-feed transition events must be signed by 51% Data-feed-Stake consensus, and any block containing these transactions is {Proof-of-Skill, Proof-of-Data-feed}

	Time-sync transition events must be signed by 51% Time-sync-Stake consensus, and any block containing these transactions is {Proof-of-Points , Proof-of-Time-sync}

####RPC - Deterministic transactions
State events trigger deterministic transactions. Payload may include Pre and Post processing RPC calls. 

1. RPC
2. DATA
3. RPC 

###Priority Blocks
Some blocks have higher priority than others.


	A Proof-of-Points Transaction Block, can only contain transactions and is only valid in specific states.  

	A Data-feed Transition Block can also contain Transaction events. 

Note: once a transition event has consensus, a block can be immediately "forged" by NXT like Proof-of-Stake(value)
