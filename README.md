Source Code
-----------
This repositiory contains the open source protoblock blockchain, fantasybit token and proof-of-skill consensus code. 

This is a work in progress. Code from two private repositories, fantasybit-2015 and protoblock-2017 is being cleaned, and cherry picked here. The result will be working code for running full decentralized p2p blockchain full-nodes, with proof-of-skill block-signing for consensus every 40 seconds.
